## Summary of the Project

In this project, I will be inquiring the cars data. I made this research to understand the correlation between the car specifications depending on the region
in which the car produced. The analysis will be made on the the following subjects:

~~~~~
- How fuel consumption change by different specifications of the cars?
- Is there a correlation between the horsepower/engine displacement and time to reach 100 km/h?
- How does change the specifications of the cars by region?

I made this project as part of the Data Analyst formation of Wild Code School. The goal of the project is to make the analysis and publish it on streamlit.

The link of the database used in this project is as follows: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murpi/wilddata/master/quests/cars.csv'
